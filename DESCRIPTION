Description: This package provides an R interface to the Core Hunter software
    for core subset selection. Cores can be constructed based on genetic marker
    data, phenotypic traits, a precomputed distance matrix or any combination of
    these. Various measures are included such as Modified Rogers' distance and
    Shannon's diversity index (for genotypes) and Gower's distance (for phenotypes).
    Core Hunter can also optimize a weighted combination of several measures, to
    meet both the breeder's and geneticist's expectations.
